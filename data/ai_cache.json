      "description": "The `/api/test` endpoint is a simple GET endpoint designed for testing and validation purposes. It does not require any parameters or request body and can be used to verify the basic functionality and connectivity of the API.",
      "security_analysis": "Since this endpoint is a test endpoint with no parameters or request body, the security risks associated with it are relatively low. However, it is essential to ensure that proper access controls are in place to prevent unauthorized access to this endpoint. Additionally, monitoring and logging should be implemented to track usage and detect any unusual or suspicious activities.",
      "risk_assessment": "- Risk Level: Low\n- Risk Score: 2/10\n- Key Risk Factors: Lack of input validation, potential for unauthorized access if not properly secured.",
      "recommendations": [
        "1. Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to this endpoint.",
        "2. Consider rate limiting to prevent abuse or DoS attacks on this endpoint.",
        "3. Regularly monitor and log access to this endpoint to detect any unusual patterns or suspicious activities.",
        "4. Even though it is a test endpoint, ensure that it follows secure coding practices to prevent any potential vulnerabilities.",
        "5. Consider adding API key or token-based authentication for better security control."
