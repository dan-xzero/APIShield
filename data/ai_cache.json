      "description": "The `/api/test` endpoint is a simple test endpoint that can be accessed using a GET request. It serves the purpose of validating the connectivity and functionality of the API. This endpoint does not require any parameters or request body to be provided.",
      "security_analysis": "Since this endpoint is a test endpoint with no defined parameters or request body, the security risks associated with it are relatively low. However, it is essential to ensure that proper access controls and authentication mechanisms are in place to prevent unauthorized access. Without proper security measures, this endpoint could potentially be used for reconnaissance by attackers to gather information about the API.",
      "risk_assessment": "- Risk Level: Low\n- Risk Score: 2/10\n- Key Risk Factors: Lack of input validation, potential for unauthorized access if not properly secured.",
      "recommendations": [
        "1. Implement proper authentication mechanisms such as API keys, OAuth tokens, or JWT tokens to control access to the endpoint.",
        "2. Consider implementing rate limiting to prevent abuse of the endpoint.",
        "3. Regularly monitor and log access to the endpoint to detect any suspicious activity.",
        "4. Even though this endpoint is low risk, it is good practice to conduct security testing, including penetration testing, to identify any vulnerabilities.",
        "5. Keep the endpoint up to date with the latest security patches and best practices to mitigate any emerging threats."

      "description": "This API endpoint is a PUT method with the path `/` and requires a request body containing JSON data. The request body must follow the schema defined in the `StoreCreditUpdateRequest` component. The purpose of this endpoint is to update store credit information. It is used to modify or update existing store credit data within the system.",
      "security_analysis": "1. Lack of Input Validation: Since there are no specific parameters defined for this endpoint, the input validation solely relies on the structure defined in the `StoreCreditUpdateRequest` schema. Without proper input validation, there is a risk of accepting malformed or malicious data.\n   \n2. Insecure Data Transmission: As this endpoint uses the PUT method, sensitive data could be transmitted in the request body. It is crucial to ensure that data is transmitted over secure channels (HTTPS) to prevent eavesdropping and data tampering.\n\n3. Lack of Authentication and Authorization: The endpoint description does not mention any authentication or authorization requirements. Without proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in place, unauthorized users could potentially access or modify store credit information.",
      "risk_assessment": "- Risk Level: Medium\n- Risk Score: 6/10\n- Key Risk Factors: Lack of input validation, insecure data transmission, and absence of authentication and authorization mechanisms pose significant risks to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of store credit data.",
      "recommendations": [
        "1. Implement Input Validation: Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.",
        "2. Secure Data Transmission: Enforce the use of HTTPS to encrypt data in transit and protect it from interception.",
        "3. Implement Authentication and Authorization: Require valid credentials for accessing and modifying store credit data. Implement role-based access control to restrict unauthorized access.",
        "4. Implement Rate Limiting: To prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks, consider implementing rate limiting mechanisms to control the number of requests from a single client within a specific timeframe.",
        "5. Monitor and Log Activities: Implement logging and monitoring mechanisms to track API usage, detect anomalies, and investigate any suspicious activities for better security posture and incident response."

The endpoint accepts a list of integers in the request body, representing active location IDs. Additionally, it can take an optional query parameter `regionId` to filter active locations by region.",
      "security_analysis": "1. Lack of Summary and Description: The absence of a summary and description for the endpoint can lead to confusion for API consumers, potentially resulting in misuse or incorrect usage.\n2. Lack of Authentication and Authorization: Without specifying any authentication or authorization mechanisms, the endpoint is vulnerable to unauthorized access and potential data breaches.\n3. Lack of Input Validation: The endpoint does not specify any input validation mechanisms, making it susceptible to injection attacks, malformed data, and potential security vulnerabilities.\n4. Potential Data Exposure: Sending active location IDs in the request body without proper encryption or masking could expose sensitive information to eavesdroppers or man-in-the-middle attacks.",

        "3. Secure Data Transmission: Encrypt sensitive data, such as active location IDs, during transmission using HTTPS to protect against data interception and unauthorized access.",
        "4. Provide Detailed Documentation: Add a clear summary and description for the endpoint, along with detailed usage instructions and examples, to guide API consumers on how to interact securely with the endpoint."
